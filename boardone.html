                <p class="mb-4">Pastor Lowell U. Collins is the seventh child born to the late Brother Artie
                    and late Mother Marian Collins. Mother Collins often testified of being with
                    child at an age when no other children were expected and from his birth,
                    she recognized that he was a child sent from God.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    A graduate of Washington Senior High School, he continued his education
                    receiving a Bachelor of Science Degree in Social Work from Bowie State
                    College. He received his Master of Science Degree in Social Work from the
                    University of Wisconsin-Madison. He continues to attend classes to
                    maintain credentials as a Certified Social Worker so that he can effectively
                    provide services. He later completed his studies in Counseling and
                    Theology, earning a Ph.D. from Parkersburg Bible College in West Virginia.
                    Though, he obtained much learning from man and books, but it was from
                    God he received a divine call into the ministry. He is currently pursuing a
                    doctoral degree in Executive Leadership at the University of Charleston,
                    Charleston, West Virginia.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    In 1978, during his service in the United States Army, he was commissioned
                    as a Second Lieutenant and promoted to Captain. He was honorably discharged as a Major from the U.
                    S. Army
                    Medical Department.
                    Pastor Collins has authored two books, “New Beginnings: A Guide for the New Believer” and “Your Debt
                    is a
                    Demon”, that are copyright by the U. S. Library of Congress in May 2000.
                    His childhood years of church exposure were under the pastorship of the late Bishop James L. Brown.
                    Obeying the
                    preached Word of God, Pastor Collins repented, was baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for the
                    remission of his
                    sins and received the Holy Ghost speaking in tongues as the Spirit of God gave utterance. In 1982,
                    under the
                    spiritual leadership of the late Bishop William L. Bonner, Pastor Collins was ordained an Elder and
                    worked
                    faithfully with the COOLJC ministry for 14 years.
                    Pastor Collins’ mission abroad included establishing churches in Germany, Norway, and Romania. In
                    declaring the
                    plan of salvation, he has ministered in Africa, Asia, Austria, Brazil, Canada, Central America,
                    Eastern Europe,
                    England, Hungary, India, Italy, Jamaica, Wales, and the Philippines. He continues to build
                    fellowship with believers
                    in Argentina, Chili, and Indonesia, as well as other assemblies throughout the United States.
                    After 15 years of living in Germany, Elder Collins speaks of divine intervention from God leading
                    him to return
                    home. Not fully understanding why, but being obedient to God, he began making frequent trips home
                    while
                    continuing to pray and fast for understanding and direction. The Lord further pressed upon him to
                    reach other
                    Apostolic brothers to develop a fellowship. From this vision was the beginning of the International
                    General
                    Assembly (IGA) of Apostolic Believers’ Fellowship. The IGA will host its twenty-sixth-year
                    conference virtually in
                    May 2022.

                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Elder Collins was installed as Pastor of the United Church of the Lord Jesus Christ of the Apostolic
                    Faith in
                    Westover and Denton, Maryland, on March 28, 1999. Bishop M. J. Hernandez of Miami, Florida,
                    officiated at the
                    service and offered prayer for the Pastor and laypersons that God would continue to bless their
                    labor in the
                    gospel field.

                    Over the years as Pastor, Elder Collins has labored diligently promoting unity in the Body of
                    Christ. Much of his
                    ministry has involved outreach and ministering locally and abroad. He established an International
                    Mission Team
                    in 2000 who have traveled to Africa, Canada, Egypt, Germany, Indonesia, Jamaica, Romania, and the
                    Philippines.
                    He established prison ministry at Eastern Correctional Institute and Poplar Hill Correctional
                    Facility where many
                    souls were baptized.
                    Pastor Collins continues to express his desire to work towards building fellowship with the people
                    of God and to
                    bring unity, faith, and love among the brethren. He strives to promote peace and harmony to
                    strengthen the Body
                    of Christ by ministering and showing respect and honor to the great men of God and their work.
                    Pastor Collins is constantly seeking means of providing humanitarian services to the less fortunate
                    at home and
                    abroad. To find him taking food to the homeless who are sheltered under bridges, in the woods, or in
                    shelters or
                    handing out candy or some kind of treats to children is who he is and how he enjoys spending time.
                    His unselfish
                    acts draws others, even children, to join him in expressing love and concern to those who have
                    fallen on hard
                    times.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    During the pandemic of 2020, and which yet continues, like other assemblies worldwide, the United
                    Church held
                    virtual services. This virtual platform enabled Pastor Collins and the elders to minister to people
                    who would never
                    have had an opportunity to enter the doors of the United Church; but people far and near are able to
                    “attend”
                    Sunday services weekly as well as the Bible study sessions on Wednesday evening.
                    Pastor Collins sees himself as a brother-minister and servant, one who loves the “old time way”, and
                    willing to be
                    used by the Lord. His humanitarian heart takes him into places that are unfamiliar, but he does so
                    to reach souls
                    that are often forgotten and pushed away. He desires to reach people who are losing hope, many who
                    are outside
                    our sanctuaries and yet often within reach of the church; these are “the least among His.”
