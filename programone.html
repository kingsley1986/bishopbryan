Humanitarian the heartbeat of Christ, Matthew 25:35-40
As I travel around the world I have seen too many suffering
Too many hurting and hungry people, especially the children
Too many people in poverty. We just don’t want to be hearers
of the word but also doers of the word.At New Birth Church
of Christ International, we are dedicated to do Wherever we can
To help around the world, to put a smile on someone’s face.
Not only are we going to help financially but also to empower
them, to give them the necessary tools to achieve in life
