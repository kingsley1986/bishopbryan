                    <p class="mb-4">Growing up in a single parent home, Reverend Dr. Errol Sterling, was molded
                    with strong Christian values. His life story begins in Annotto Bay, St. Mary,
                    Jamaica where he went to church with his mother.

                    In 1999 he walked in his divine calling as a Pastor. In that same year he attended
                    Aenon Bible College and upon obtaining my Ministerial Certificate and was also
                    ordained as a Pastor by the Pentecostal Assemblies of the World. After learning
                    and accomplishing much, he founded the church he now pastors: True Light
                    Apostolic Church Of Jesus Christ.
                    
                    After building his church within the will of God he was eager to learn more and
                    started to attend Canadian West Indian Apostolic College where he received other
                    Ministerial Certificates. In addition he attended the Philadelphia Christian
                    Fellowship, he received even more Ministerial Certificates in the path of pursuing
                    his dream as a Pastor.

                    Having a relationship with his congregation, he saw that they was a need for
                    counselling, so he decided to gain further education to best aid his members. At
                    the Canadian Christian Theological Seminary, in Calgary, Alberta he obtained
                    his Bachelor and Master's Degree in Counselling and now operating his own
                    Counselling Business, E.G.S Counselling Services as a Certified Clinical
                    Counsellor.
                    
                    Reverend Sterling is a husband and a father of five. He is a humble servant of
                    God who has a true calling on his life, to evangelize his christian beliefs by
                    reaching lost souls for the Kingdom of God.
